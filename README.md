# Job Hunt Helper

This project was started to help track my job hunt statistics, and it can help you too!

## Usage

Click on the green "Code" button above (near the About section) and copy the HTTPS link.

Next, open your terminal and type

```
$ git clone {the HTTPS link copied earlier}
```

Then, cd into the new folder and type

```
$ npm install
```
(This will install the required dependencies)

Lastly, run the React project using

```
$ npm start
```

That's it! Now you can begin using the website to track your job search statistics.
